This template was created for MS Surface devices which have 0.19Ghz issue, when CPU is locked on throttling all the time.
To fix the issue launch the "copy.bat" as administrator. 
Batch file will copy ThrottleStop program to the hidden folder in C:/ThrottleStop/ and add it to the task scheduler, so it runs everytime on system startup. 
Enjoy :)
